                <p style="font-size: 22px; margin: 10px">This solution is undoubtedly and evidently easy and effective, but how would this plan be executed? This is where governments, leaders, and the majority of civilians around the world will have to agree on and work in unison together, which they indubitably will, in order to make this mission successful. I propose that all people would undergo an eco-friendly mass genocide akin to the Holocaust with concentration camps, except that it is actually for the greater good and most involved consent to the act. The venue of these events will be in a large, specially built arena-like structures that would have the capacity to hold thousands of people at once and would commence the process of Aquamation (or also called Alkaline Hydrolysis), a process similar to cremation where a mixture of different chemicals and boiling water is filled into a container with the bodies and effectively dissolving the bodies, leaving only ashes, but on a larger scale in this case. Luckily, this process is also eco-friendly and would not cause as much environmental damage such as other alternatives such as cremation, or traditional casket burial. These structures would be built by recycling the materials of many other buildings and structures and other materials from cars and trains, as to not create any more emissions than needed and also since there would be no one to use these anyway. For lesser developed countries that would not be able to accommodate the construction of these structures however, they would have to resort to burying their citizens alive in a “Green Burial” where the bodies are to not be embalmed or preserved in any way and put in a biodegradable casket in order for their bodies to decompose naturally and have the bodies’ nutrients and other chemicals return to the earth and serve as a kind of fertilizer for new plants which is an added bonus of this process as the many flora that would flourish in these areas would reduce the carbon dioxide from the earth’s atmosphere and also provide shelter for new wildlife. When this all inevitably goes successful and all according to plan, The Earth would still take time to recover, approximately 5 Million years. This may seem like a long time, but the earth has been around for 4.543 Billion years. 5 Million years is only 0.11% of its lifetime and to put that into perspective, 0.11% of someone’s lifetime who is 20 years old would only amount to a week, which in comparison, is quite a fast recovery for a life-threatening disease.</p>
