                <p style="font-size: 24px; margin: 10px">A common way to help solve Climate Change and Global Warming being thrown around by climate scientists, politicians, and climate-activists alike is “net zero emissions” which is quite self-explanatory, meaning that worldwide, we would have to have zero emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. This obviously seems like a big task to undertake, but to answer problems, we need to get to their cause. Climate Change is caused by many factors, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and the excess of Greenhouse Gasses. The obvious answer is to redirect our funding to research and application of ways to reduce these factors and ultimately reverse the two centuries worth of damage caused by humans. But in order to cure a patient, we don’t just try and get rid of the symptoms, we have to actively get rid of the underlying cause. The disease. In our planet’s case the disease is the Human Population. It’s no surprise that Climate Change had started to take place during the Industrial Era as this is the era in which humans figured out how to mass produce all kinds of materials for their survival or even their own amusement, altering the world to their needs. Thus, the true solution is to eliminate the entirety of the human population akin to euthanasia or mass genocide. </p>
