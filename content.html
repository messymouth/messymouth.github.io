                <p style="font-size:17px; margin-right: 15px;">As a species, Humanity has conquered and lived through many devastating disasters in our time on the Earth such as massive volcanic eruptions, deadly typhoons, disease & sickness, and even two worldwide wars. We endured all these calamities and came out better and more prepared, But this time, it’s different. If action isn’t taken as soon as possible, There is no going back or coming out of it either. Our children and our children’s children and even more generations to come would have to suffer the consequences and live in a world where the sea levels have flooded entire cities, where the icecaps are nowhere to be seen, where the air is too dangerous to even breathe in, where the only animals that roam the earth are insects and plants only grow in controlled environments underground. A world where the few surviving humans await their early and inevitable, painful demise, all while suffering greatly. This problem of course, is Climate change. Everybody nowadays knows about it. We have been causing damage to the Earth since the Industrial Revolution and have started taking action almost 40 years ago though to little success. Every year a new terrifying record has been broken and the effects are evident with all the wildfires and floods and other disasters occurring worldwide. To be able to solve Climate Change we must first come together as a species, exert the necessary effort required by all of us, and be ready to make sacrifices along the way. For us to achieve this end, I propose an undeniably effective, yet simple, course of action and solution to this situation.</p>
